[Application of a photovoltaic power forecasting system based on dynamic optimal evaluation in new energy enterprises ]
Description
[The entire project consists of three main code files: main.py, model.py, and visualization.py. The main.py file includes data import, preprocessing, and the construction of the dynamic optimal evaluation system. The model.py file contains all the models in the model pool. The visualization.py file includes visualizing the prediction results.]
