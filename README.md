A photovoltaic power prediction system with a dynamic selection evaluation mechanism breaks through the limitations of traditional single time-series models. The framework establishes an accuracy and stability evaluation system, quantifying model performance through standardization processing and competitive scoring mechanisms. In the prediction results section, dynamic weight allocation is implemented for the top two models using constrained optimization methods, and quantile loss functions are introduced to enhance interval prediction capabilities.
